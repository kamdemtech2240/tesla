What is a Computers 
  Computers have 2 components  = Hardware + Software
     Hardware: CPU, Screen, keyboard, mouse, harddrive, RAM, Cards   
     software: OS = Operating system, applications    

Types of Computers:  
  Personal Computers: Desktop, Laptop, IPADs, Tablets, Phones, etc. 
  work Computers: Workstations, Servers (super computers)   

Types Operating systems running in computers:
    Linux OS []
       Majority of Workstations, Servers (super computers)  
    Windows OS []
       Majority of Workstations, Laptops, Desktop
    Solaris OS []
    IOS []
    Androids []

We are leveraging computing serviceS from AWS and GCP
 Linux OS = 
   Is an Open source OS = Free + code 

 Linus was a student who converted a problem to a business
 Solaris wasn't an open source = paid for 
 Create a free Account in AWS =  

Computer Vendors:
  Dell, HP, Lenovo, Toshiba, Apple
      A Dell Laptop with a windows OS is a Windows Computer  
      An HP Desktop with a Linux OS is a Linux Computer 
      An LG Desktop with a Linux OS is a Linux Computer 

Car Vendors:
  Toyota, Tesla, Ford, Honda

Linus was using a Solaris computer for his project.
   -- Encounter a problem running his project  
   -- He contacted the vendor but the response delayed     

Linus created the Linux OS from Solaris kernel []:

Linux is an open source OS with multiple destributions/versions.
Windows, Solaris, MacOS, etc are licenced OS.
Softwares can be:
  1. open source [Free with its source code]  
     open source softwares has more community support

  2. Free [free but without the source code(recipe)] 
  3. licenced [paid for]  

IQ: Explain your experience in Open SOURCE TECHNOLOGY?? Linux,

IQ: How to execute tasks/workloads on your computers:
     1. GUI = Graphical User Interface  = 60k
            -- This is generally a method manual to run tasks
     2. CLI = Command Line Interface =    90k
            -- This introduces tasks automation   
     3. Scripts = Are generally a collection of commands = 180k 
           -- amplifies tasks automation

  This will be ultra-fast 


     https://aws.amazon.com/ 
Amazon is the parent company of AWS 
    amazon.com 
    aws.amazon.com

We use write and deliver letters:
  ups, dhl  
  email   

 Create a free Account in AWS =  
    https://aws.amazon.com/ 

Create and Login into your AWS Account:
  userName  
  password
Create a virtual server [EC2] in YOUR AWS ACCOUNT/Cloud. 

3. Connect to your Linux server running in AWS using:
    1. ssh-client software [provide a passage]
         mobaXterm, puTTY, gitBash
         Download an install mobaXterm ssh-client software
    2. identification = userName  
    3. authentication = password or an SSH_KEY   
    4. AUTHORISATION = what you do in the server  
       Tasks that a user is AUTHORISE to execute  

AWS 90%:
   Admin[mobaXterm]  ---- > EC2-Linux 

GCP 10%:

    Folders or Directories is/are containers of 
      files and sub folders/sub Directories 
  sub-folders


Windows File Structure:
root/main/parent Directory:
  This is the principal Directory where 
  other Directories are created from
 The root Directory for windows is:
    c://  
    C:\Users\LandmarkTechnologies\Documents
    "C:\Users\LandmarkTechnologies\Downloads"
    "C:\Users\LandmarkTechnologies\Music"
    "C:\Users\LandmarkTechnologies\Documents\class29"

Linux File Structure:
=====================
   Linux file Structure start with the root Directory [/]
  
home Dir = Users 
================
   Create user account for 5 team members 
   ec2-user 
   dominion  
   simon 
   mercy 
   keren 

bin = contains of binary files[commands] 
=========================================
 - ls = list the contant of a Directory [files/sub-directoriers]
 - touch = create an empty file  
 - cd    = change Directory
 - cat   = display file content
 - pwd   = print working Directory

sbin = system/super bin
========================
 - adduser simon
 - passwd simon
What is the difference between bin and sbin in Linux? 
 sbin are binary flies only executable by the root user or users 
   with admin/elevated priviledges 
 bin files are executable by any user 

userName = root is the administrator, super user with unlimited access 
root user is created when launching a Linux server

Permissions: 
  Permissions are used to determine who can access a file and   
  what they can do with the file. Generally we have the following interest

SHELL SCRIPT
Shell is an interpreter: It interprete command to the OS
  a shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and give  them to the OS platform

  a shell intyerprete command that are type 
  On most linux system, a program called bash(which stands for bourne again Shell) act as the shell program. Besides Bourne shell programs that can be installed in Linux system. 
    These include:
      Korn Shell(ksh), Boune Again(bash), and Shell(csh)

    Command that can be used to 
      touch test.txt is created because we have a shell that is wirking in our system

      echo $SHELL
        == bin/bash                   bash is the bash interpretor
       cat /etc/passwd

        ----    ----      -----   ----
                
What is the default umask value for the root user and NormalUser??
Because of 0022 umask value for the rootUser, files created by the 
root user will inherit 0644 permissions

Since the mask value for NormalUsers is 0002, files created by the 
normal users will inherit 0664 permissions.  

Set the umask value if all files should inherit 0666 permissions?
   umask 0000   
   -rw-rw-rw- = 666. 1 ec2-user ec2-user  0 Jul 23 17:10 file.js

group  rw = 6  rwx=7
others rw = 6  rwx=7

IQ: How can set the permissions of new files/dir?? 
  By changing the umask value.

IQ: What is the default umask value for:
      1: NormalUser  = umask is 0002
      2. rootUser    = umask is 0022


IQ: How can you change/modify the permissions of an existing file/dir ??
  By using the chmod  command.  
    chmod 600 fileName   
    chmod 600 deploy

1. sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
   change PasswordAuthentication from "no" to "yes"
2. restart your ssh service  
   sudo systemctl restart sshd 
3. assigne password to users

      mon itor.sh === 2GB
      app.log ===5GB
    total size ==9.8 * 2 = 19.6GB == We cannot backup without zipping or compressing because it will consume toom much the resources  

  Zip                   app.zip
  unzip                 app.unzip
  tar -c  
    tar -c = will compress the file

System Resources Commands 
  command uses to check the resources of our system
--------------------------
--------------------------

servers are commontly called system
  my system is linx or Windows or Mac
  Server are furnishes with ressources suvch as 
     cpu, RAM=Memory, hardrive=ROM, USERS

Team 
dominium
landmark
erica
chidi

  who, w, last
  who display the current users workin on the system.
  w: DShow who is logged on and what they are doing.
  users: Display a compact list of the users currently logged on the system.
  whoami: Display the current user info who gave this command
  whereis : path/locate the binary , source, and manual page file for a command.
  date: Print or set the system date and time
  df: Rport file system disk space usage
  du: estimate file space usage
  hostname: show or set the system host name.

  To find the IP address
    public 
      curl ifconfig.co

    ifconfig 
    private
      hostanme -i 
      ip 

======================================================================
======================================================================
To enter confifuration that will allow us to change the password Authentication from no to yes
	sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
	s: To restart the computer after making a  								change

To assign password to user
    sudo passwd simon

ls /home
sudo useradd Ola     to add user called ryan
sudo useradd -m ryan           -m create a home while adding  
                                user on all linux platform
ls /home  will display the user currentl in the home dir 
sudo passwd ryan

To  add user to the sudoers file:
     sudo vi /etc/sudoers
        add ryan(user) under root   
        root     ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL 
        ryan     ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL    in insert
            then press ESCs
            then :wq!      or :x!

To see user in the file
     sudo cat /etc/sudoers

To stwich user 
      su - username
      su - ryan

 If $ only       adduser     useradd
 To use the correct shield,   $ bash(we type bash)

  cat /etc/sudoers      if permission deny
  sudo cat /etc/sudoers

  cat /etc/sudoers 

  ls /home       will show the list of users in the home directory

  cat /etc/passwd



To change user permission from no to yes:
    sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config
       go to insert mode
       change passwdauthentication from yes
       press esc key to exit insert mode
       then :wq! to save the change
       then enter

    To restart   sudo systemctl restart sshd

To connect to MobaXterm
      shh userName@publicIPadress
      curl ifconfig.co
       ssh ryan@3.85.160.93

      
      password:

To verify type w to see who is connected.       

======================================================================
======================================================================
To exit the home of ec2-user and go the ryan
   sudo su - ryan
   use exit log out the current user.


last: show user that have been connected to the server
users: list the user that are connected to the sytem now
whoami: it show whoo is currently performing task
who:
w :

bin durector are made of binary file. binary file are command

whereis ls
whatis : will tell you what the command do

date: 
  echo update server at 1am daily
  tasks scheduling is done using cron tables: 

  date -s === is use to set the time
  date -s "20220725 20: 20:15" == to change the date

timedatectl  
  timedatectl list-timezones
  timedatectl set-timezone yourTimezome    == to set time zone
  timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York

  systemctl list-unit-files :It will loist all services

df: report how much ressource the system has
  df -h
du

service = It will give the status of service. systems/servers has   
    ultiple services to function effectively, deploy and expose applications

    ssh  = secure shell service
    sshd is the secure shell or ssh services
    NTPD= NTP(network Time Protocol) is use to manage the system time
    Or NTPD uses NTP to manage system time

    HTTPD uses http as a web server

Service can be in the following stste:
  started|restarted|stopped|disabled|enabled  

IQ: If younstop SSHD, can you shh into your service? : No
   
   To check if the service is running:
    
      service serviceName status 
       service sshd status 
       service httpd status 

       systemctl status serviceName 
       systemctl status shttpd
       systemctl status ntpd
       systemctl status nt



ls -h
ls -lh == Meant that it is display information in human reading format

hostanme show or set the system hostname : 
  hostname can be use to identify a server in the network, 
  to helps communicate and connect with other servers.
  hostanme help in health check

hostname new-hostname   : To change hostanme

su -simon

curl ifconfig.co   = Will display the ip address

hostname -i = Will display the private ip


======================================================
========== Process Management Command ================
======================================================

ps: Display the current process running in our server
      ps -ef == display all process that are running
      ps -ef | grep processname == will grep(extract) a specific process
      ps -ef | grep httpd == will extract httpd prcoess
free -m == tell you how much memory you have and how much is being used

kill: hill the process

top: Display Linux tasks , it give you a complete picture of how the  system is running.

sar : 9system activity Report): It is used to collect the CPY, menary and I/O usage.

IQ: What will you do if you discorver  the process isconsuming     
  over 90 percent of the resource.
  ans: Kill the process with the kill command

  zombie processes == process that had no impact on our work load,     
    but is c onsuming our system resources.
 IQ: How will you troubleshoot a slow running linux server??
    we can run:
    1. df -h == To check how much ressources is being consume
    2. free -m == to chech how much memory is still available in 
        the  system 
    3. top == give the process running and the ressources they are    
      consuming. will also identify the zombie processes
    Then: Once identify, we can kill those process or resource that    are consuming those processes.
      kill -9 processID  
    


yum = is used to install any package into our system. it search the [particular package and install it.

======================================================================
============== linux Video 6 reading================================
===================================================================   
HLD(hight level documentation)= system requirements
  df / df -h= check tyhe file system
  du / df -h =check how much resources the syetm is consuming
  free/ free -h =  to know how much memory is being used

  who: show who is connected
  w: who is connected and what they are doing
  date
  man
  whatis
  uptime

  yum install/ updates/remove/upgrade

  yum intall nano -y
  yum updates filename 


  yum updates == will update all packages
  yum upgrade tree 
  yum upgrade ==  will upgrade a;ll packages

Tickect === Someone was not able to querry whatis ls , whatis grep
    solution  = sudo mandb == it create or update the manual page index
                              caches


  

  sudo yum remove programName == to uninstall the program
  sudo yum remove nano == to uninstall nano

ps == use to show the process running on our server
  ps -ef == show all the process running in our server
  ps -ef | grep sshd  == will grep sshd process
    from the list of precocess  
  ps -ef | grep ssh  == will grep ssh process
    from the list of process        


=================== Archeive/Data Backup Commands ======================
zip= packtake and compress files
unzip = Extract compressed files in azip archive
tar=  = It is used to archive the ditrectory/file

    let have:
      deploy.sh === 800MB
      apps.js  === 2GB[2000MB]
      mon itor.sh === 2GB
      app.log ===5GB
    total size ==9.8 * 2 = 19.6GB == We cannot backup without zipping or compressing because it will consume toom much the resources  

  Zip                   app.zip
  unzip                 app.unzip
  tar -c  
    tar -c = will compress the file
    tar -cfv =compress the file in verbose mode.    tar -cfv app.log 
    tar -x = will extract the compress file 
    tar -xfv = will extract the compress file  in verbose mode         

      we want to backup the above data
 Why should we bacup the date?
  because we can go back to the abckup if aour data are corrupted or lost(power outrage, system failure)
